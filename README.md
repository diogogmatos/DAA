This project was developed as a requirement for the **Data and Machine Learning (Dados e Aprendizagem AutomÃ¡tica)** course in the **Master's in Informatics Engineering** program at the **University of Minho** for the 2024/2025 academic year. Its core objective is to design and optimize **Machine Learning (ML) models** to **predict the progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD)** in patients. The solution analyzes **radiomics characteristics** extracted from MRI scans of two brain regions: the **hippocampus** (DShippo dataset), a region known to be relevant to memory and Alzheimer's, and the **occipital lobe** (DSocc dataset), which serves as a control. The process involved extensive data exploration, preparation, and the implementation of various ML techniques, including **Decision Trees, SVMs, Ensemble Learning (Bagging, Random Forest, XGBoost), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks**, to validate the hypothesis that hippocampal radiomics features are critical for early prediction of cognitive decline.
